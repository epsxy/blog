<center>
Without a sound I took her down<br />
And dressed in red and blue I squeezed<br />
Imaginary wedding gown<br />
That you can't wear in front of me

A kiss goodbye<br />
Your twisted shell<br />
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet<br />
Let's say goodbye, the hundredth time<br />
And then tomorrow we'll do it again

Tomorrow we'll do it again

I dragged her down I put her out<br />
And back there I left her where no one could see<br />
And lifeless cold into this well<br />
I stared as this moment was held for me

A kiss goodbye<br />
Your twisted shell<br />
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet<br />
Let's say goodbye, the hundredth time<br />
And then tomorrow we'll do it again

I never thought it'd be this way<br />
Just me and you, we're here alone<br />
And if you stay, all I'm asking for is<br />
A thousand bodies piled up<br />
I never thought would be enough<br />
To show you just what I've been thinking

And I'll keep on making more<br />
Just to prove that I adore<br />
Every inch of sanity<br />
All I'm asking for is<br />
All I'm asking for is

Come on!

These hands stained red<br />
From the times that I've killed you and then<br />
We can wash down this engagement ring<br />
With poison and kerosene<br />
We'll laugh as we die<br />
And we'll celebrate the end of things<br />
With cheap champagne

Without, without a sound<br />
Without, without a sound<br />
And I wish you away<br />
Without a sound<br />
And I wish you away<br />
Without a sound<br />
Without a sound<br />
And I wish you away<br />
Without a sound<br />
Without a sound<br />
And I wish you away<br />
Without a sound<br />
Without a sound<br />
And I wish you away
</center>
